# Simple Spotify Search

- In this lab we will work to create an app that searches the Spotify database and displays results.
- Step 1: Navigate over to the [Spotify API Documentation](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/) and find the endpoint to "Search for an item".
- Step 2: Open up app.js and change the "endpoint" variable to the endpoint you found in the documentation.
- Step 3: Add a click handler for the "Search" button on the index.html document. You can see an [example here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/XUL/Attribute/onclick). The function name you need to call is performSearch().
- Step 4: Test out your app by searching for a song.
